                By using NELA ride services, you acknowledge and agree to the
                following:
              </p>

              <div className="space-y-2">
                <p>
                  <strong>1. Independent Contractor Relationship:</strong> NELA
                  operates as a platform connecting passengers with independent
                  drivers. Drivers are not employees or agents of NELA.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>2. Service Availability:</strong> NELA does not
                  guarantee ride availability, driver acceptance, or specific
                  arrival times. Estimated times are approximations only.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>3. Pricing:</strong> All prices are estimates and may
                  vary based on actual distance, time, and route taken. Final
                  fare is determined at trip completion.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>4. Payment:</strong> You agree to pay all charges for
                  rides booked through your account. Payment methods must be
                  valid and current.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>5. Cancellation:</strong> Rides may be cancelled by
                  either party. Drivers may cancel without penalty. Passengers
                  may be subject to cancellation fees as posted.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>6. User Conduct:</strong> You agree to behave
                  respectfully, follow driver instructions, and comply with all
                  applicable laws. Inappropriate behavior may result in service
                  termination.
